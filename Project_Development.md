# Macro-Assist — Project State

## What It Does

A fully automated daily macro intelligence pipeline. Every weekday it fetches economic and market data, passes it to Claude Sonnet for analysis, and writes a structured Markdown note into an Obsidian vault. A separate weekly job scores the directional accuracy of Claude's predictions and feeds those statistics back into the next day's prompt as a self-calibration loop.

## Architecture

```
GitHub Actions (daily, Mon-Fri 07:30 UTC)
    collect_and_analyze.py
        -> FRED API          (macro indicators)
        -> yfinance          (prices + sector ETFs)
        -> BLS JSON          (economic calendar)
        -> Supadata API      (YouTube transcripts)
        -> Claude Sonnet     (main analysis)
        -> Claude Sonnet     (adversarial review pass)
        -> Obsidian vault    (output note)
        -> Macro-Assist repo (copy of report for scorer)

GitHub Actions (weekly, Monday 07:15 UTC)
    score_predictions.py    (score past predictions via yfinance)
    summarize_accuracy.py   (aggregate scores -> accuracy_summary.json)
        -> Obsidian vault    (accuracy_report.md)
        -> Macro-Assist repo (.macro-assist/data/accuracy_summary.json)
```

Two repos are involved:
- **Macro-Assist** — code, workflow files, accuracy data, report copies (`results/`)
- **External-Brain** — Obsidian vault; receives the daily note and accuracy report

## Data Sources

### FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
Fetched via `fredapi`. 5-year history is pulled for each series to enable historical context (5yr mean, vs-mean comparisons). Every series includes `days_stale` so Claude can apply tiered staleness rules.

| Key | FRED Series | Frequency | Notes |
|-----|------------|-----------|-------|
| `fed_funds_rate` | FEDFUNDS | Monthly | |
| `cpi` | CPIAUCSL | Monthly | YoY % and 5yr mean YoY computed |
| `gdp` | GDP | Quarterly | Often 60-90 days stale |
| `unemployment` | UNRATE | Monthly | |
| `m2` | M2SL | Monthly | YoY % and 5yr mean YoY computed |
| `treasury_10y` | DGS10 | Daily | |
| `treasury_2y` | DGS2 | Daily | |
| `hy_spread` | BAMLH0A0HYM2 | Daily | ICE BofA HY OAS; 5yr mean computed |
| `philly_fed_mfg` | GACDFSA066MSFRBPHI | Monthly | Philly Fed diffusion index; 5yr mean computed |
| `real_yield_10y` | DFII10 | Daily | 10Y TIPS real yield; 5yr mean computed |
| `breakeven_10y` | T10YIE | Daily | 10Y inflation breakeven; 5yr mean computed |

Derived: `yield_curve_spread` = 10Y minus 2Y (computed inline).

### Market Data (yfinance)
10-day history fetched for notable-move detection (rolling std). A `vix_term_ratio` (VIX / VIX3M) is computed to distinguish acute stress (backwardation) from anticipated volatility (contango).

| Key | Ticker | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `sp500` | ^GSPC | |
| `nasdaq` | ^IXIC | |
| `gold` | GC=F | |
| `wti_oil` | CL=F | |
| `vix` | ^VIX | |
| `dxy` | DX-Y.NYB | |
| `vix3m` | ^VIX3M | Used only for term ratio; not in snapshot table |

**Sector ETFs** (5-day history): XLE, XLK, XLF, XLI, XLY. Injected as a separate block to enable sector-level divergence analysis in the Equities section.

**Notable Moves detector**: flags any asset where `|daily_change| >= 2 * 10d rolling std` AND exceeds a per-asset minimum absolute threshold (e.g. 1.5% for equities, 2.0% for oil). VIX and VIX3M excluded. Output is a `## Notable Moves` block prepended to the prompt, with a system prompt rule to open the relevant section with that signal.

### Economic Calendar
- **BLS releases**: fetched live from `https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/schedule.json`. Filters for CPI, PPI, Employment Situation within the next 7 days.
- **FOMC dates**: hardcoded list in `collect_and_analyze.py`. **Must be updated every January.** Source: `https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm`

### YouTube Transcripts (Supadata API)
- YouTube RSS feed (no auth) detects videos published in the last 36 hours per channel.
- Full transcript fetched via Supadata REST API (`x-api-key` header, `text=true`). Free tier: 100 req/month.
- Claude Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) pre-summarises each transcript into 6-8 macro-relevant bullet points, stripping stock picks and promotions.
- Summaries injected as `## Analyst Video Insights` into the main prompt.

Configured channels (in `collect_and_analyze.py`):
| Channel | ID |
|---------|----|
| Bravos Research | UCOHxDwCcOzBaLkeTazanwcw |

## Analysis Model Logic

### Main Pass — Claude Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, max 3000 tokens)

The system prompt (`prompts/system_prompt.md`) instructs Claude to produce exactly these sections in order:

1. **Executive Summary** — 2-4 sentences, single most important development
2. **Macro Dashboard** — signal matrix (9 indicators x 4 asset classes: Equities / Bonds / Commodities / Crypto)
3. **Equities** — index moves, risk character, sector divergence, VIX context
4. **Rates & Fed Policy** — Fed Funds trajectory, yield levels, curve shape, real yields vs. breakevens
5. **Inflation & Growth** — CPI trend, GDP + unemployment, M2, stagflation risk
6. **Commodities** — Gold (real yield cross-reference), WTI, DXY context
7. **Portfolio Risk Assessment** — (only when CSV present) position-level macro alignment, concentration, rate/FX sensitivity, one actionable observation
8. **Key Risks & Themes** — 3-5 actionable bullets for the next 1-4 weeks
9. **5-Day Predictions** — directional forecasts table (6 assets, Bias / Target Range / Confidence / Primary Driver)

Key rules baked into the system prompt:
- `days_stale` tiered treatment: ≤14 days = current signal; 15-30 = note date once; >30 = trend only, mark "(stale)" in Dashboard
- Confidence bounded 50%-80% (no false certainty)
- Historical context anchored to `five_yr_mean` when available
- VIX term structure ratio interpreted as acute vs. anticipated stress
- Notable moves opened first in their section
- Economic calendar events flagged in relevant section + Key Risks if within prediction window
- YouTube transcripts treated as secondary source (one citation per section max)

### Adversarial Review Pass — Claude Sonnet (max 600 tokens)

A second Claude call reviews the predictions table against the Key Risks section. Applies a high bar: only lowers confidence (by 5-10pp) and annotates Primary Driver with `[Risk: label]` if a listed Key Risk would make the directional call **outright wrong** if it materialised (not merely uncertain). Confidence is hard-floored at 50% in code regardless of model output. Changes are logged to stdout for inspection in CI.

### Self-Calibration Feedback Loop

`accuracy_summary.json` (tracked in `.macro-assist/data/`) is injected into each daily prompt as `## Your Historical Prediction Accuracy`. Claude is instructed to use directional accuracy stats (only when `n >= 8`) to calibrate confidence. Assets with directional accuracy below 40% are flagged as having systematic bias.

---

## Output Format

Notes are written as Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
day: Monday
type: macro-intelligence
tags: [macro, daily-note, economics]
---
```

Path: `Economy/YYYY/MM-Month/YYYY-MM-DD-Weekday-macro.md`

The note appends a **Data Snapshot** section with raw market and FRED tables — Claude never sees this; it is added by `build_note()` after analysis.

---

## Prediction Evaluation

### score_predictions.py

Runs weekly (Monday). Finds all `*-macro.md` reports, parses the 5-Day Predictions table, and scores each prediction at three horizons:

| Window | Trading Days |
|--------|-------------|
| T+5 | 5 (1 week) |
| T+10 | 10 (2 weeks) |
| T+20 | 20 (1 month) |

Only scores reports where the evaluation date has fully passed (plus 1-day buffer). All prices fetched from yfinance — never from the report's own data snapshot.

**Scoring logic:**

| Outcome | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Direction correct | 1.0 |
| Direction wrong | 0.0 |
| Move is flat (below threshold) OR call is Neutral | 0.5 |

Flat thresholds: 3 bps for 10Y Treasury Yield; 0.5% for all other assets.

Output: `results/scores/YYYY-MM-DD.json` per report.

### summarize_accuracy.py

Aggregates all score JSONs into two metrics per asset per window:

- **Overall accuracy** — all calls including Neutral/flat (0.5 = random baseline)
- **Directional accuracy** — only Bullish/Bearish calls with 0/1 outcomes; excludes flat moves and Neutral calls (signal quality metric)

Outputs:
- `.macro-assist/data/accuracy_summary.json` — tracked in git, read by daily pipeline
- `results/accuracy_report.md` — human-readable, copied to vault

## Portfolio Intelligence Module (In Development)

A hands-on investment assistant layer built on top of the macro pipeline. Reads the user's Trade Republic transaction export to surface position-level risk and macro-aligned opportunities.

### Architecture

```
data/tr_positions.csv          (manual export from TR app)
    parse_positions.py
        -> aggregate net positions (BUY - SELL per ISIN)
        -> yfinance current prices (USD→EUR via EURUSD=X)
        -> portfolio summary dict

Daily pipeline (collect_and_analyze.py)
    -> [optional] inject ## Portfolio Positions block into prompt
    -> Claude Sonnet: position risk + macro alignment commentary

On-demand (planned)
    -> opportunity_scan.py      (macro-driven watchlist: 3-5 candidates)
    -> deep_dive.py             (single-stock deep analysis)
```

### parse_positions.py

Located at `.macro-assist/parse_positions.py`. Reads `data/tr_positions.csv` (path overridable via `POSITIONS_CSV` env var).

**What it computes:**
- Net shares per asset (cumulative BUY − SELL)
- Average cost basis in EUR (from transaction amounts)
- Current price in EUR (yfinance; USD assets converted via EURUSD=X)
- Unrealized P&L (EUR + %)
- Portfolio allocation %

**ISIN → ticker resolution (three-layer lookup):**

1. **Hardcoded `ISIN_TO_TICKER` dict** — crypto shortcodes (BTC/ETH/SOL), bonds, ETFs with known EUR tickers, and any manual overrides. Always wins.
2. **Local cache** (`data/ticker_cache.json`) — resolved mappings from previous OpenFIGI lookups. Committed alongside the CSV so CI doesn't re-query.
3. **OpenFIGI API** — free ISIN→ticker lookup (no API key required, 25 req/min). Called automatically for unknown ISINs on first run, then cached. Exchange is selected by ISIN country prefix (US ISINs → NASDAQ/NYSE; IE/FR/DE ISINs → Xetra/Euronext Paris).

**Result:** pushing an updated `tr_positions.csv` with a new position is sufficient — no code changes needed for standard equity ISINs. Bonds, crypto, and ETFs with ambiguous exchange listings remain in the hardcoded dict for precision.

**Hardcoded overrides** (kept in `ISIN_TO_TICKER`):

| Symbol | Asset | Ticker | Currency |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| BTC | Bitcoin | BTC-EUR | EUR |
| ETH | Ethereum | ETH-EUR | EUR |
| SOL | Solana | SOL-EUR | EUR |
| IE00B44Z5B48 | MSCI ACWI ETF | SPYY.DE | EUR |
| IE000KCS7J59 | MSCI EM ETF | — (no reliable feed) | EUR |
| FR0010790980 | Stoxx Europe 50 ETF | C50.PA | EUR |
| IE00BJ38QD84 | Russell 2000 ETF | ZPRR.DE | EUR |
| DE0001135226 | German Bund 2034 | — | EUR |
| JE00B588CD74 | WisdomTree Swiss Gold | — | EUR |

**Output:** `format_portfolio_for_prompt()` renders a Markdown table for Claude injection.

**CLI check:** `python .macro-assist/parse_positions.py data/tr_positions.csv`
