# Macro-Assist — Project State

## What It Does

A fully automated daily macro intelligence pipeline. Every weekday it fetches economic and market data, passes it to Claude Sonnet for analysis, and writes a structured Markdown note into an Obsidian vault. A separate weekly job scores the directional accuracy of Claude's predictions and feeds those statistics back into the next day's prompt as a self-calibration loop.

## Architecture

```
GitHub Actions (daily, Mon-Fri 07:30 UTC)
    collect_and_analyze.py
        -> FRED API          (macro indicators)
        -> yfinance          (prices + sector ETFs)
        -> BLS JSON          (economic calendar)
        -> Supadata API      (YouTube transcripts)
        -> Claude Sonnet     (main analysis)
        -> Claude Sonnet     (adversarial review pass)
        -> Obsidian vault    (output note)
        -> Macro-Assist repo (copy of report for scorer)

GitHub Actions (weekly, Monday 07:15 UTC)
    score_predictions.py    (score past predictions via yfinance)
    summarize_accuracy.py   (aggregate scores -> accuracy_summary.json)
        -> Obsidian vault    (accuracy_report.md)
        -> Macro-Assist repo (.macro-assist/data/accuracy_summary.json)
```

Two repos are involved:
- **Macro-Assist** — code, workflow files, accuracy data, report copies (`results/`)
- **External-Brain** — Obsidian vault; receives the daily note and accuracy report

## Data Sources

### FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
Fetched via `fredapi`. 5-year history is pulled for each series to enable historical context (5yr mean, vs-mean comparisons). Every series includes `days_stale` so Claude can apply tiered staleness rules.

| Key | FRED Series | Frequency | Notes |
|-----|------------|-----------|-------|
| `fed_funds_rate` | FEDFUNDS | Monthly | |
| `cpi` | CPIAUCSL | Monthly | YoY % and 5yr mean YoY computed |
| `gdp` | GDP | Quarterly | Often 60-90 days stale |
| `unemployment` | UNRATE | Monthly | |
| `m2` | M2SL | Monthly | YoY % and 5yr mean YoY computed |
| `treasury_10y` | DGS10 | Daily | |
| `treasury_2y` | DGS2 | Daily | |
| `hy_spread` | BAMLH0A0HYM2 | Daily | ICE BofA HY OAS; 5yr mean computed |
| `philly_fed_mfg` | GACDFSA066MSFRBPHI | Monthly | Philly Fed diffusion index; 5yr mean computed |
| `real_yield_10y` | DFII10 | Daily | 10Y TIPS real yield; 5yr mean computed |
| `breakeven_10y` | T10YIE | Daily | 10Y inflation breakeven; 5yr mean computed |

Derived: `yield_curve_spread` = 10Y minus 2Y (computed inline).

### Market Data (yfinance)
10-day history fetched for notable-move detection (rolling std). A `vix_term_ratio` (VIX / VIX3M) is computed to distinguish acute stress (backwardation) from anticipated volatility (contango).

| Key | Ticker | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `sp500` | ^GSPC | |
| `nasdaq` | ^IXIC | |
| `gold` | GC=F | |
| `wti_oil` | CL=F | |
| `vix` | ^VIX | |
| `dxy` | DX-Y.NYB | |
| `vix3m` | ^VIX3M | Used only for term ratio; not in snapshot table |

**Sector ETFs** (5-day history): XLE, XLK, XLF, XLI, XLY. Injected as a separate block to enable sector-level divergence analysis in the Equities section.

**Notable Moves detector**: flags any asset where `|daily_change| >= 2 * 10d rolling std` AND exceeds a per-asset minimum absolute threshold (e.g. 1.5% for equities, 2.0% for oil). VIX and VIX3M excluded. Output is a `## Notable Moves` block prepended to the prompt, with a system prompt rule to open the relevant section with that signal.

### Economic Calendar
- **BLS releases**: fetched live from `https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/schedule.json`. Filters for CPI, PPI, Employment Situation within the next 7 days.
- **FOMC dates**: hardcoded list in `collect_and_analyze.py`. **Must be updated every January.** Source: `https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm`

### YouTube Transcripts (Supadata API)
- YouTube RSS feed (no auth) detects videos published in the last 36 hours per channel.
- Full transcript fetched via Supadata REST API (`x-api-key` header, `text=true`). Free tier: 100 req/month.
- Claude Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) pre-summarises each transcript into 6-8 macro-relevant bullet points, stripping stock picks and promotions.
- Summaries injected as `## Analyst Video Insights` into the main prompt.

Configured channels (in `collect_and_analyze.py`):
| Channel | ID |
|---------|----|
| Bravos Research | UCOHxDwCcOzBaLkeTazanwcw |

## Analysis Model Logic

### Main Pass — Claude Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, max 3000 tokens)

The system prompt (`prompts/system_prompt.md`) instructs Claude to produce exactly these sections in order:

1. **Executive Summary** — 2-4 sentences, single most important development
2. **Macro Dashboard** — signal matrix (9 indicators x 4 asset classes: Equities / Bonds / Commodities / Crypto)
3. **Equities** — index moves, risk character, sector divergence, VIX context
4. **Rates & Fed Policy** — Fed Funds trajectory, yield levels, curve shape, real yields vs. breakevens
5. **Inflation & Growth** — CPI trend, GDP + unemployment, M2, stagflation risk
6. **Commodities** — Gold (real yield cross-reference), WTI, DXY context
7. **Portfolio Risk Assessment** — (only when CSV present) position-level macro alignment, concentration, rate/FX sensitivity, one actionable observation
8. **Key Risks & Themes** — 3-5 actionable bullets for the next 1-4 weeks
9. **5-Day Predictions** — directional forecasts table (6 assets, Bias / Target Range / Confidence / Primary Driver)

Key rules baked into the system prompt:
- `days_stale` tiered treatment: ≤14 days = current signal; 15-30 = note date once; >30 = trend only, mark "(stale)" in Dashboard
- Confidence bounded 50%-80% (no false certainty)
- Historical context anchored to `five_yr_mean` when available
- VIX term structure ratio interpreted as acute vs. anticipated stress
- Notable moves opened first in their section
- Economic calendar events flagged in relevant section + Key Risks if within prediction window
- YouTube transcripts treated as secondary source (one citation per section max)

### Adversarial Review Pass — Claude Sonnet (max 600 tokens)

A second Claude call reviews the predictions table against the Key Risks section. Applies a high bar: only lowers confidence (by 5-10pp) and annotates Primary Driver with `[Risk: label]` if a listed Key Risk would make the directional call **outright wrong** if it materialised (not merely uncertain). Confidence is hard-floored at 50% in code regardless of model output. Changes are logged to stdout for inspection in CI.

### Self-Calibration Feedback Loop

`accuracy_summary.json` (tracked in `.macro-assist/data/`) is injected into each daily prompt as `## Your Historical Prediction Accuracy`. Claude is instructed to use directional accuracy stats (only when `n >= 8`) to calibrate confidence. Assets with directional accuracy below 40% are flagged as having systematic bias.

---

## Output Format

Notes are written as Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
day: Monday
type: macro-intelligence
tags: [macro, daily-note, economics]
---
```

Path: `Economy/YYYY/MM-Month/YYYY-MM-DD-Weekday-macro.md`

The note appends a **Data Snapshot** section with raw market and FRED tables — Claude never sees this; it is added by `build_note()` after analysis.

---

## Prediction Evaluation

### score_predictions.py

Runs weekly (Monday). Finds all `*-macro.md` reports, parses the 5-Day Predictions table, and scores each prediction at three horizons:

| Window | Trading Days |
|--------|-------------|
| T+5 | 5 (1 week) |
| T+10 | 10 (2 weeks) |
| T+20 | 20 (1 month) |

Only scores reports where the evaluation date has fully passed (plus 1-day buffer). All prices fetched from yfinance — never from the report's own data snapshot.

**Scoring logic:**

| Outcome | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Direction correct | 1.0 |
| Direction wrong | 0.0 |
| Move is flat (below threshold) OR call is Neutral | 0.5 |

Flat thresholds: 3 bps for 10Y Treasury Yield; 0.5% for all other assets.

Output: `results/scores/YYYY-MM-DD.json` per report.

### summarize_accuracy.py

Aggregates all score JSONs into two metrics per asset per window:

- **Overall accuracy** — all calls including Neutral/flat (0.5 = random baseline)
- **Directional accuracy** — only Bullish/Bearish calls with 0/1 outcomes; excludes flat moves and Neutral calls (signal quality metric)

Outputs:
- `.macro-assist/data/accuracy_summary.json` — tracked in git, read by daily pipeline
- `results/accuracy_report.md` — human-readable, copied to vault

## Portfolio Intelligence Module (In Development)

A hands-on investment assistant layer built on top of the macro pipeline. Reads the user's Trade Republic transaction export to surface position-level risk and macro-aligned opportunities.

### Architecture

```
data/tr_positions.csv          (manual export from TR app)
    parse_positions.py
        -> aggregate net positions (BUY - SELL per ISIN)
        -> yfinance current prices (USD→EUR via EURUSD=X)
        -> portfolio summary dict

Daily pipeline (collect_and_analyze.py)
    -> [optional] inject ## Portfolio Positions block into prompt
    -> Claude Sonnet: position risk + macro alignment commentary

On-demand (planned)
    -> opportunity_scan.py      (macro-driven watchlist: 3-5 candidates)
    -> deep_dive.py             (single-stock deep analysis)
```

### parse_positions.py

Located at `.macro-assist/parse_positions.py`. Reads `data/tr_positions.csv` (path overridable via `POSITIONS_CSV` env var).

**What it computes:**
- Net shares per asset (cumulative BUY − SELL)
- Average cost basis in EUR (from transaction amounts)
- Current price in EUR (yfinance; USD assets converted via EURUSD=X)
- Unrealized P&L (EUR + %)
- Portfolio allocation %

**ISIN → ticker resolution (three-layer lookup):**

1. **Hardcoded `ISIN_TO_TICKER` dict** — crypto shortcodes (BTC/ETH/SOL), bonds, ETFs with known EUR tickers, and any manual overrides. Always wins.
2. **Local cache** (`data/ticker_cache.json`) — resolved mappings from previous OpenFIGI lookups. Committed alongside the CSV so CI doesn't re-query.
3. **OpenFIGI API** — free ISIN→ticker lookup (no API key required, 25 req/min). Called automatically for unknown ISINs on first run, then cached. Exchange is selected by ISIN country prefix (US ISINs → NASDAQ/NYSE; IE/FR/DE ISINs → Xetra/Euronext Paris).

**Result:** pushing an updated `tr_positions.csv` with a new position is sufficient — no code changes needed for standard equity ISINs. Bonds, crypto, and ETFs with ambiguous exchange listings remain in the hardcoded dict for precision.

**Hardcoded overrides** (kept in `ISIN_TO_TICKER`):

| Symbol | Asset | Ticker | Currency |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| BTC | Bitcoin | BTC-EUR | EUR |
| ETH | Ethereum | ETH-EUR | EUR |
| SOL | Solana | SOL-EUR | EUR |
| IE00B44Z5B48 | MSCI ACWI ETF | SPYY.DE | EUR |
| IE000KCS7J59 | MSCI EM ETF | — (no reliable feed) | EUR |
| FR0010790980 | Stoxx Europe 50 ETF | C50.PA | EUR |
| IE00BJ38QD84 | Russell 2000 ETF | ZPRR.DE | EUR |
| DE0001135226 | German Bund 2034 | — | EUR |
| JE00B588CD74 | WisdomTree Swiss Gold | — | EUR |

**Output:** `format_portfolio_for_prompt()` renders a Markdown table for Claude injection.

**CLI check:** `python .macro-assist/parse_positions.py data/tr_positions.csv`

## Improvement Roadmap

All phases are implementable at $0 cost using existing API keys (FRED, yfinance) plus one new free provider (Nasdaq Data Link for Phase 3).

### Phase 1 — Expand the Free Data Pipeline *(Completed 2026-04-28)*

**Goal:** Bring in high-frequency economic and liquidity data.

**New FRED series to add in `collect_and_analyze.py`:**

| Series | Description | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `WALCL` | Fed Total Assets | Weekly |
| `WTREGEN` | Treasury General Account | Weekly |
| `RRPONTSYD` | Reverse Repo | Daily |
| `ICSA` | Initial Jobless Claims | Weekly |
| `NFCI` | Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index | Weekly |

**Fed Net Liquidity calculation (Python, before Claude call):**
```
Net Liquidity = WALCL - WTREGEN - RRPONTSYD
```
Compute WoW and MoM % change. Pass only the derived signal to Claude — e.g. `"Net Liquidity: Expanding, +1.2% WoW"`.

---

### Phase 2 — Shift the "Quant" Burden to Python *(Completed 2026-04-28)*

**Goal:** Stop asking Claude to infer trends from raw prices. Feed it pre-calculated technical states.

1. **Expand yfinance history window** from 10 days → **90 days** in `collect_and_analyze.py`. No cost difference.

2. **Add technical indicators** (via `pandas` or `pandas_ta`) for S&P 500, Gold, Oil, DXY, Bitcoin:
   - **14-day RSI** — flag as `Overbought` (>70), `Oversold` (<30), or `Neutral`
   - **Distance from 50-day MA** — e.g. `"+3.2% above 50d MA"`
   - **60-day Z-Score** — replace the simple notable-move detector

3. **New prompt block:** Structure output as `## Technical & Positioning State` table injected before Claude's analysis sections.

---

### Phase 3 — Add Free Positioning Data (COT)

**Goal:** Get institutional positioning data for Commodities and Currencies.

**Requires:** Free [Nasdaq Data Link](https://data.nasdaq.com/) API key → add as `NASDAQ_DATA_LINK_KEY` secret in GitHub Actions.

- Add `nasdaq-data-link` to `requirements.txt`
- Fetch **Net Non-Commercial** positioning (hedge fund speculators) for WTI Crude and Gold from CFTC via Nasdaq Data Link
- Compute percentile of current positioning vs. 1-year lookback
- Signal to Claude: `"Maximally Long"` (contrarian bearish headwind) or `"Maximally Short"` (contrarian bullish signal)

---

### Phase 4 — Overhaul System Prompt & Guardrails

**Goal:** Force Claude to use the new data correctly and cure observed doom bias in equity predictions.

**Rules to add to `prompts/system_prompt.md`:**

> **RULE (Equities):** Fed Net Liquidity and Technical Trend supersede lagging economic indicators (like GDP). Do not predict an equity correction based solely on poor macro data if Net Liquidity is expanding and the index is above its 50-day MA.

> **RULE (Commodities):** Heavily weight COT speculative positioning. If speculators are extremely long, treat this as a contrarian headwind.

**Optional — Quantitative Override for T+20 S&P 500:**
If `accuracy_summary.json` still shows S&P 500 T+20 directional accuracy below 35% after several weeks with the new data, implement a hard override in `collect_and_analyze.py`: after Claude generates the prediction table, check historical directional accuracy for that asset; if systematically wrong, flip `Bearish` → `Bullish` and annotate: `"Call inverted programmatically due to historical model bias."` The S&P 500 T+20 directional accuracy is currently **0%** (n=11), making this the strongest candidate for the override.

### Suggested Execution Order

| Priority | Phase | Effort | Prerequisite | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Phase 1 (FRED liquidity + jobless claims) | Low | None | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Phase 2 (90d history + RSI/MA/Z-score) | Medium | None | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Phase 4 (system prompt rules) | Low | Phases 1 & 2 deployed | Pending |
| 4 | Phase 3 (COT via Nasdaq Data Link) | Medium | New API key | Pending |
